How our UI for our editor view works:
-user can select a cell see the row content and write the contents in that cell in the given text box at the top of the JFrame. 
-The user can then select "¡Ì" button if they want to write the current content in that cell or "¡Á" to clean the content of the cell.
-But there are some error in our model which if the user enter a function, it will has shows a error message, this is not caused by our view and controller
